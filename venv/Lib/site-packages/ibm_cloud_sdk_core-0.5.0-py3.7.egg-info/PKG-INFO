        # python-sdk-core
        This project contains the core functionality used by Python SDK's generated by the IBM OpenAPI 3 SDK Generator (openapi-sdkgen).
        Python code generated by openapi-sdkgen will depend on the function contained in this project.
        
        ## Installation
        
        To install, use `pip` or `easy_install`:
        
        ```bash
        pip install --upgrade ibm-cloud-sdk-core
        ```
        
        or
        
        ```bash
        easy_install --upgrade ibm-cloud-sdk-core
        ```
        
        ## Authentication Types
        There are several flavors of authentication supported in this package. To specify the intended authentication pattern to use, the user can pass in the parameter `authentication_type`. This parameter is optional, but it may become required in a future major release. The options for this parameter are `basic`, `iam`, and `icp4d`.
        
        ### basic
        This indicates Basic Auth is to be used. Users will pass in a `username` and `password` and the SDK will generate a Basic Auth header to send with requests to the service.
        
        ### iam
        This indicates that IAM token authentication is to be used. Users can pass in an `iam_apikey` or an `iam_access_token`. If an API key is used, the SDK will manage the token for the user. In either case, the SDK will generate a Bearer Auth header to send with requests to the service.
        
        ### icp4d
        This indicates that the service is an instance of ICP4D, which has its own version of token authentication. Users can pass in a `username` and `password`, or an `icp4d_access_token`. If a username and password is given, the SDK will manage the token for the user.
        A `icp4d_url` is **required** for this type. In order to use an SDK-managed token with ICP4D authentication, this option **must** be passed in.
